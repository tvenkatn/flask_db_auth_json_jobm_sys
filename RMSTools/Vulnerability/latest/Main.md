This tool tests the integrity of Vulncache\Vulnerability database and verifies that the data is properly transferred between RL tables and HD tables

#### Test-0: Database Information 
Check if database includes  both RiskLink and HD Tables or only includes RiskLink Tables


```
		List of countries:US
		List of perils:EQ
		Database includes risklink tables.
		Database includes HD tables.
```

The Countries in this database are us .
